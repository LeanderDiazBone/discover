# DISCOVER: Automated Curricula for Sparse-Reward Reinforcement Learning

This repository implements the methods and experiments presented in the "DISCOVER: Automated Curricula for Sparse-Reward Reinforcement Learning" paper (Link).
The implementation of the core off-policy RL algorithms and evaluatioon environments is adapted from the JaxGCRL repository (https://github.com/MichalBortkiewicz/JaxGCRL).

## Getting started

### Installation

Requires Python 3.10.

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Documentation



### Reproducing the experiments

The `examples` directory contains python scripts that reproduce the experiments from the paper.
These examples simultaneously serve as examples of how to use the library.
